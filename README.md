# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Educational Project

## Description

This project provides an educational implementation and exploration of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It aims to demonstrate the core concepts of KNN using a clear and understandable dataset.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica), characterized by four features:

*   Sepal Length (cm)
*   Sepal Width (cm)
*   Petal Length (cm)
*   Petal Width (cm)

The goal is typically to classify the species based on these features.

*(Note: If a different dataset is used, please update this section accordingly.)*

## Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN is a simple, non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.

*   **Classification:** An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small).
*   **Working Principle:**
    1.  Calculate the distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the query instance and all the training instances.
    2.  Sort the distances in ascending order and select the top k instances (the k nearest neighbors).
    3.  For classification, perform a majority vote among the classes of these k neighbors. The class with the most votes becomes the prediction for the query instance.

## Usage

*(This section should be updated based on how the project is structured and run. Examples below.)*

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.x
*   Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (or specify others if used)

**Running the Code:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd EDU-KNearestNeighbors
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If a requirements.txt file exists)*
3.  Run the main script (e.g., `main.py` or a Jupyter Notebook):
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook KNN_Implementation.ipynb
    ```

## Project Structure

*(Optional: Briefly describe the key files and directories)*

*   `data/`: Contains the dataset file(s).
*   `src/` or `/`: Contains the source code (e.g., KNN implementation, data loading, evaluation).
*   `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Results

*(Optional: Summarize any key findings, accuracy metrics, or visualizations generated by the project.)*

For example:

*   The KNN model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set with k=Y.
*   Visualizations show clear separation between certain classes based on petal dimensions.
